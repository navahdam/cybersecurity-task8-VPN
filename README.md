# VPN Privacy and Encryption Task

## Objective
This task explores how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) protect user privacy and encrypt internet traffic. The goal is to gain hands-on experience by setting up and testing a VPN client, analyzing its effect on privacy and network behavior.

## Tools Used
- VPN Client: Windscribe (Free)
- Browser: Google Chrome or Firefox
- IP Checker: whatismyipaddress.com
- Encryption Check: HTTPS and browser certificate info

## Setup Steps

1. Selected a free VPN (Windscribe)
2. Created an account
3. Downloaded and installed the VPN client
4. Connected to a VPN server (nearest location)
5. Verified IP change using whatismyipaddress.com
6. Opened HTTPS websites to confirm encryption
7. Disconnected the VPN and compared:
   - IP address
   - Browsing speed and website access

## Observations

- IP address successfully changed when connected to VPN
- Traffic was encrypted using HTTPS and the VPN tunnel
- Browsing speed was slightly reduced depending on the server
- VPN effectively hid the real location and secured the data connection

## Screenshots

- VPN connection status
- IP address before and after VPN connection
(Screenshots are available in the `screenshots` folder.)

## Summary

VPNs are effective tools for improving online privacy and security. They encrypt your internet traffic and mask your IP address. However, they may impact connection speed and do not guarantee complete anonymity.
