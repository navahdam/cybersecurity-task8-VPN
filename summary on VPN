VPN Benefits and Limitations:

A "VPN (Virtual Private Network)" helps protect your privacy and secure your internet traffic by encrypting the data between your device and the VPN server. This hides your real IP address and makes it harder for websites, internet providers, or hackers to track your online activity.

During setup, I used a free VPN client (Windscribe) and connected to a VPN server. After connection, I verified my IP address had changed and visited websites using HTTPS to confirm my traffic was encrypted. Even if the browser didn’t show a padlock, the URL began with `https://`, which indicates that the connection is secure.
